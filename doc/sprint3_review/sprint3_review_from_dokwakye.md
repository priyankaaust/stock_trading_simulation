|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Attendance & Participation**| How well did the team member consistently attend meetings? | Always attended meetings but occasionally distracted during longer sessions. | Excellent attendance, but timely joining is an area to refine for smoother starts. | Highly reliable in attendance, with only a few instances of late arrivals during this sprint. |
|                               | How actively was the team member involved in discussions? | Participated actively, though sometimes overanalyzed points, slowing down discussions. | Shared thoughtful inputs but could engage more proactively during brainstorming sessions. | Regularly contributed valuable insights, though more direct engagement on technical issues could be beneficial. |
| **Communication**             | How clear and timely was the team member's communication? | Communicated effectively but could condense updates to focus on key points. | Clear communicator but should aim for more frequent progress updates. | Communicated well overall but occasionally delayed responses when blockers occurred. |
|                               | How well did they keep others informed of progress and issues? | Provided progress updates regularly but transparency on complex blockers can be improved. | Shared updates efficiently but could provide more context on longer tasks. | Progress updates were consistent, though more structured reporting could enhance clarity. |
| **Productivity & Accountability** | How effectively did the team member complete tasks on time? | Delivered tasks on time, but quality occasionally suffered due to multitasking. | Met deadlines consistently but could allocate more time to testing. | Excellent task completion rate, though minor delays in documentation were observed. |
|                               | How efficient was the team member in managing tasks?      | Managed tasks efficiently but prioritization of critical tasks needs refinement. | Task management was solid, though occasional overlaps with others' tasks were noted. | Managed tasks effectively but could improve in handling simultaneous responsibilities. |
| **Collaboration & Teamwork**  | How willing was the team member to assist others?         | Always willing to help, though occasionally overextended on non-critical tasks. | Supportive team member but could anticipate assistance needs more proactively. | Frequently assisted others but could delegate small tasks to maintain focus on priorities. |
|                               | How well did their work fit with project specs and deadlines? | Work aligned well with project goals but required occasional last-minute adjustments. | Delivered work matching specs but more detailed initial reviews could improve outcomes. | Consistently met specs, though exploring alternatives earlier might reduce revisions. |
| **Use of Tools & Processes**  | How effectively did the team member use communication tools? | Utilized tools effectively, though automating recurring tasks could save time. | Good tool usage but more updates on the Kanban board would improve visibility. | Excellent use of tools, though streamlining workflows could reduce redundancies. |
|                               | How well did they follow the processes and standards set?      | Adhered to processes well but simplifying workflow steps could enhance efficiency. | Followed standards diligently but occasionally skipped minor review stages. | Consistently followed standards, though adapting documentation formats could save time. |
| **Workload Balance**          | How well did the team member manage their workload?        | Balanced workload effectively, though occasionally stretched on high-priority tasks. | Managed workload well but could distribute tasks more evenly to avoid crunch periods. | Handled workload efficiently but taking short breaks during intensive phases might improve sustainability. |
|                               | Did they seem overburdened or need support, and how was it managed? | Rarely overburdened, but delegating less urgent tasks could improve focus. | Occasionally overburdened; identifying blockers earlier would streamline task completion. | Handled tasks confidently but seeking support earlier for blockers could enhance efficiency. |
| **Additional Feedback**       | General suggestion for improvement                   | Focus on simplifying complex tasks to improve turnaround time without compromising quality. | Share progress updates more proactively to maintain team alignment. | Consider taking the lead on technical challenges to showcase expertise and drive results. |
|                               | Other feedback (If any)                                  | Strong contributor, but balancing critical and non-critical tasks could enhance overall impact. | Reliable and supportive team player—focus on refining task planning for better productivity. | Proactive and dependable—continue leveraging leadership opportunities for team benefit. |
