# Description

The stock trading simulation online application allows players to test their trading skills using real-time stock market data in an exciting and competitive atmosphere. Players are given a virtual startup amount upon registration, which they can use to purchase and sell stocks at current NYSE prices in order to expand their portfolio. In addition to viewing thorough trade histories and tracking the profitability of their portfolio, the players can also keep an eye on their placement on the leaderboard to see how they compare to other players. The platform offers a user-friendly, interactive interface together with real-time market trends and stock price updates. In addition, players can interact with game-specific regulations, personalize their profiles, and, depending on how the game is configured, access the portfolios of their rivals. At the end of the game, the player with the highest portfolio value is declared the winner, making every trading decision crucial for success. The exciting and strategic gameplay is maintained by the thrill of simulated trading, the possibility of in-game events, and the dynamic market environment.

## Player perspective

At the beginning of the game, all players will have an equal virtual account balance to be used for trading. Players will have the option to buy and sell (trade) stocks. The decision to trade any stock will greatly impact their account balance. Players will gain when their stock investments rise. Conversely, if their purchased stock value drops, they will incur losses. Players will have the option to sell an already purchased stock if they feel they will lose more. Additionally, players can buy more stocks that are performing well in the market. At the end of the game, the results of their decisions will reflect in their account balance. The player with the highest account balance will be declared the winner.

## Admin perspective

The administrator can start the game using the admin portal. While the game is running, the stock prices are automatically updated; however, the admin can trigger updates from time to time. If any technical issues are detected, the administrator can quickly address them to ensure the game runs smoothly. Essentially, the administrator ensures the game operates effectively within the given time frame.
