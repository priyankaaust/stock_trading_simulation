# Task Assignment of Priyanka

1.List the features of application
   - The goal is to create a detailed list of the core and optional features of the trading simulation application, explaining what each feature does and how it benefits the users or the system.

2.Create a description of the trading game/simulation from the admins perspective.
   - As an admin overseeing the trading game/simulation, the role involves managing the platform's overall functionality, ensuring smooth operations, and maintaining fairness within the trading environment. The admin has access to a comprehensive control panel that provides tools for user management, market simulation adjustments, and system monitoring.

3.Create an additional document called design.md covering the proposed component architecture and coding tools.
   - This document outlines the proposed component architecture and coding tools for the trading game/simulation application. The architecture is divided into frontend, backend, and database components, with clear definitions of the technologies and coding tools to be used throughout the development process.

4.Define the general web framework architecture.
   - A general web framework architecture consists of multiple layers that work together to deliver a dynamic, secure, and scalable web application. These layers help separate responsibilities between the client, server, database, and security systems. 

5.Create an additional document called process_model.md covering the process model
