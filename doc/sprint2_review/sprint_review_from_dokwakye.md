|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Attendance & Participation**| How well did the team member consistently attend meetings? | Consistently attended all meetings, but occasionally joining earlier could streamline starts. | Excellent attendance, though could sometimes join a bit earlier to help kick off discussions on time. | Always present and highly engaged, but occasional absences during longer sessions were noted. |
|                               | How actively was the team member involved in discussions? | Actively participated and shared insights, though sometimes dominating discussions. Providing space for others could improve balance. | Contributed thoughtfully but occasionally stayed silent when more critical analysis was needed. | Frequently involved in discussions but could focus more on articulating opposing viewpoints to enrich dialogues. |
| **Communication**             | How clear and timely was the team member's communication? | Communicated clearly, though some updates tended to overexplain, which could be streamlined. | Generally clear in communication but could improve by providing more proactive updates. | Maintained clarity but could break down complex updates for better team understanding. |
|                               | How well did they keep others informed of progress and issues? | Regular updates were provided, but transparency on blockers could be enhanced. | Kept the team informed, though updates were not always frequent enough for longer tasks. | Shared progress effectively, but occasionally delayed updates until prompted. |
| **Productivity & Accountability** | How effectively did the team member complete tasks on time? | Consistently completed tasks, though taking on fewer responsibilities could improve quality. | Met deadlines but sometimes rushed near the end. Smaller milestones could prevent this. | Delivered high-quality work but a focus on prioritization could enhance timeliness for minor tasks. |
|                               | How efficient was the team member in managing tasks?      | Managed tasks well but occasionally struggled with prioritizing less urgent work. | Task management was solid, though multitasking under pressure showed room for improvement. | Highly efficient overall, but perfectionism sometimes delayed progress unnecessarily. |
| **Collaboration & Teamwork**  | How willing was the team member to assist others?         | Always willing to help, though stepping back occasionally to let others resolve issues independently would be beneficial. | Very supportive but could initiate help more often without waiting to be asked. | Strong teamwork spirit, but delegating more tasks might enhance overall efficiency. |
|                               | How well did their work fit with project specs and deadlines? | Delivered work aligning with project goals, though early reviews of specifications could prevent last-minute changes. | Work generally fit project specs but occasional oversights suggest room for more detailed reviews. | Produced high-quality work, though exploring multiple approaches earlier could reduce revisions. |
| **Use of Tools & Processes**  | How effectively did the team member use communication tools? | Used tools effectively but could explore more automation to save time. | Proficient with tools but could update project boards more frequently. | Excellent use of tools but overly detailed inputs could be streamlined for quicker reference. |
|                               | How well did they follow the processes and standards set?      | Followed processes well but some workflows could be simplified to save time. | Adhered to standards but occasionally skipped minor steps that impacted overall consistency. | Consistently followed standards but could focus on reducing overly detailed steps for greater efficiency. |
| **Workload Balance**          | How well did the team member manage their workload?        | Managed workload effectively but taking on fewer tasks could avoid overextension. | Balanced workload well but sometimes appeared overwhelmed with multiple deadlines. | Handled workload smoothly but taking breaks more regularly could sustain long-term productivity. |
|                               | Did they seem overburdened or need support, and how was it managed? | Occasionally overburdened; delegating more tasks would help. | Appeared overwhelmed at times; asking for support sooner would prevent stress buildup. | Managed workload well but could benefit from requesting help earlier when needed. |
| **Additional Feedback**       | General suggestion for improvement                   | Encourage quieter team members to contribute to discussions for better team balance. | Focus on breaking larger tasks into smaller milestones to provide consistent progress updates. | Take the lead more often in discussions, as your contributions are highly valuable. |
|                               | Other feedback (If any)                                  | Reliable and supportive, but could benefit from refining focus on fewer tasks for enhanced quality. | Enthusiastic and a morale booster for the team—maintain that energy while improving task updates. | Proactive and a consistent team player—continue to leverage leadership opportunities when they arise. |
