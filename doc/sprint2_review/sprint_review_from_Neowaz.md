|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Attendance & Participation**| How well did the team member consistently attend meetings? | Kazi is very reliable with meeting attendance, but joining a bit earlier would help us start on time more smoothly. | Daniel attends meetings regularly, but arriving a bit earlier would contribute to a more efficient start. | Priyanka has been highly dependable for meetings, always present and ready to contribute. |
|                               | How actively was the team member involved in discussions? | Kazi is an active contributor, sometimes dominating discussions. Giving more space for others would enhance balance. | Daniel provides input but could benefit from challenging ideas more frequently to enrich discussions. | Priyanka's contributions are thoughtful, though speaking up earlier during discussions could bring in her perspectives sooner. |
| **Communication**            | How clear and timely was the team member's communication? | Kazi communicates clearly, but sometimes overexplains which could be simplified for clarity. | Daniel's communication is often clear but needs more proactive updates on ongoing work. | Priyanka communicates well; however, she could make complex points easier to understand by breaking them down. |
|                               | How well did they keep others informed of progress and issues? | Kazi keeps the team informed, but a bit more transparency on blockers would be helpful. | Daniel could improve by providing regular updates on his progress, particularly for longer tasks. | Priyanka does a good job of sharing progress, though adding timelines could make her updates more actionable. |
| **Productivity & Accountability** | How effectively did the team member complete tasks on time? | Kazi generally meets deadlines, but taking on fewer tasks could help ensure better focus. | Daniel completes his tasks on time but tends to rush towards deadlines; setting smaller milestones might help. | Priyanka meets deadlines well, though sometimes focusing too much on details delays completion. |
|                               | How efficient was the team member in managing tasks?      | Kazi manages his tasks well but could use better prioritization for less urgent work. | Daniel manages tasks effectively but has room for improvement in multitasking without losing focus. | Priyanka efficiently manages her workload, though perfectionism sometimes affects her pace. |
| **Collaboration & Teamwork**  | How willing was the team member to assist others?         | Kazi is very supportive, though at times stepping back to let others find solutions independently would be beneficial. | Daniel is always ready to help, but offering support without waiting to be asked could foster teamwork. | Priyanka is very helpful, but delegating certain tasks could allow her to focus on priority areas more effectively. |
|                               | How well did their work fit with project specs and deadlines? | Kazi’s work aligns well, though breaking down complex tasks earlier could prevent last-minute changes. | Daniel's work is good, though occasional mismatches with specs suggest more careful reviews are needed. | Priyanka’s work is well suited to specs, but considering different approaches at the outset could save revision time. |
| **Use of Tools & Processes**  | How effectively did the team member use communication tools? | Kazi uses tools effectively, though leveraging more automation could save time. | Daniel uses tools well but could make more frequent updates on the Kanban board. | Priyanka uses tools thoroughly, but sometimes including too much detail could be streamlined for efficiency. |
|                               | How well did they follow the processes and standards set?      | Kazi follows processes well, though streamlining steps where possible could save time. | Daniel adheres to processes, but sometimes takes shortcuts that should be avoided to maintain standards. | Priyanka follows standards diligently, but reducing some overly detailed steps could make the process faster. |
| **Workload Balance**          | How well did the team member manage their workload?        | Kazi manages his workload effectively but could delegate more to avoid burnout. | Daniel manages his workload well but appears overwhelmed when juggling multiple deadlines; prioritizing could help. | Priyanka balances her workload well, though taking breaks more regularly might help maintain her energy levels. |
|                               | Did they seem overburdened or need support, and how was it managed? | Kazi sometimes takes on too much, which could be reduced by sharing responsibilities more. | Daniel occasionally appears overburdened; asking for help earlier could prevent stress buildup. | Priyanka manages well without showing signs of stress, though she could benefit from asking for help sooner. |
| **Additional Feedback**       | General suggestion for improvement                   | Kazi could work on fostering more balanced discussions by encouraging quieter members to speak. | Daniel should focus on breaking larger tasks into smaller ones to provide consistent updates. | Priyanka should consider taking the lead in discussions more often, as her insights are very valuable. |
|                               | Other feedback  (If any)                                   | Great job overall, Kazi! Your proactive approach keeps us on track. | Daniel, keep up your enthusiasm—it really helps the team's morale. Just work on updating more often. | Priyanka, your consistent support is appreciated; continue being proactive and take on leadership roles when possible. |
